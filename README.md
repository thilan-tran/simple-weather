# Simple Weather

This is a simple weather application built with Node.js and Javascript that uses the OpenWeather API and Chart.js to display a minimal, graphical display of upcoming weather forecasts in different locations. [Icons](https://iconstore.co/icons/weather-vector-icons/)

My intention is to emulate this application with different frontend and backend frameworks, such as React or Python Django.
