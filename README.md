# Simple Weather

This is a simple weather application built using the OpenWeather API and Chart.js to display a minimal, graphical display of upcoming weather forecasts in different locations. [Icons](https://iconstore.co/icons/weather-vector-icons/)

- *Front-end implementations*:
  - [X] native JavaScript
    - `index.html index.js`
  - [X] jQuery
    - `jquery-index.html jquery-index.js`
  - [X] React
    - `react-index.html react-index.js`
  - [ ] Angular
  - [ ] Vue

- *Back-end implementations*:
  - [X] Node.js
    - `server.js`
  - [X] Flask
    - `server.py`
  - [ ] Django
  - [ ] Go
  - [ ] C#

My intention is to recreate this application with different front-end and back-end frameworks, such as React, Flask, or Django, as a self-learning project.
