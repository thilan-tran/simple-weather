# Simple Weather

This is a simple weather application built with Node.js and Javascript that uses the OpenWeather API and Chart.js to display a minimal, graphical display of upcoming weather forecasts in different locations. [Icons](https://iconstore.co/icons/weather-vector-icons/)

- *Front-end implementations*: native JavaScript, jQuery
- *Back-end implementations*: Node.js

My intention is to recreate this application with different front-end and back-end frameworks, such as React, Flask, or Django, as a self-learning project.
